Hello Eric,

Thank you for reaching out!

If you’re seeing “No internet connection” in Chrome, here are a few steps to help troubleshoot the issue:

Check Wi-Fi or Data Connection: Make sure Wi-Fi or mobile data is enabled. You can do this by going to your phone’s Settings > Wi-Fi or Mobile Data. Try switching it off and on again to refresh the connection.

Reconnect to the Network: If you’re using Wi-Fi, try disconnecting and reconnecting. Sometimes, this can help reset the connection.

Restart Your Phone: Simply restarting your phone can often resolve connectivity issues by refreshing your network settings.

Try Another App: Open another app that needs the internet, like YouTube or WhatsApp, to see if the issue is specific to Chrome or affects all apps.

Clear Chrome’s Cache: Go to Settings > Apps > Chrome > Storage, then select “Clear Cache.” This helps if there’s an issue with Chrome itself.

Update Chrome: Ensure Chrome is updated by visiting the app store. Sometimes, older versions may have bugs causing connectivity issues.

If you’re still having trouble, please let me know, and we can look into further options.

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi there,

Thanks for getting back to me! I tested a few things, and it looks like the issue is due to the way the software is set up.

If you’d like to enable the multi-currency feature, just go to Settings > General and select the checkbox for Multi-Currency.

Once that’s done, you can set up each currency under Settings > Currencies. For each one, you’ll need to:

Enter a name (e.g., USD)
Provide historical rates (e.g., 1/1/2023: 87 INR, 1/2/2023: 89 INR)
After entering the details, be sure to hit the Save button to save the changes.

Hopefully, this helps prevent similar issues down the road. Let me know if you need any more assistance!

Best,
Darmesh
